# Vivr "Look at life from the other side"


Vivr is an application that mirrors an image back and forth at a specific pace providing you with a new perspective of your photos.

Using modules and scripts, Vivr takes in a .JPEG file and returns a .MP4.

Works best with Windows media player for PC, Quicktime for Mac, and Photos for Andriod.


Currently refining code and working on deployment
